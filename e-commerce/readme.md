I am working this project for many time. I went to vacation because of this is taking long but i have other practice to do so after learning the E-commerce project I am moving to new.

Things I learn from this project:
* If there are many similar container then use the javascript array to store the container and also display it
* If it is hard to create the innerHTML then create the html in html file and style it using css and use it in Javascript
* To make slide animation it is easy to use javascript then css styling 
* Learn the drop-down sorting fucntion
* Learn the checkbox sorting function
* Got strong knowledge about position property in css

--There are few bugs here that is still not fixed I will fix it later.--

CSS bug:
* After the cart is pull from the right side you may notice grid display change is should be constant when the cart is opening but it is not. 

Javascript Bug:
* The sort of the left is not work with the drop down menu sorting
